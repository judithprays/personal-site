      <p>Oh, me? Ok. Well. My mom was a coder. 
        I was top of my Computer Science class in high school. 
        Can show you some diary entries. 
        Took a detour, but got back into coding in 2010 when I realised the 
        internet was the most powerful tool for making ideas real.
        Studied front end development at the 
        <a href="https://creativecircus.edu/" target="blank" class="text-link">circus</a>, 
        interned at <a href="http://armchairmedia.com/" target="blank" class="text-link">Armchair</a> 
        with some sweet southern geniuses. 
        As soon as I could make a website, turns out everyone needs a website.</p>
    <p>Started freelancing, had more business than I knew what to do with. 
      Did that, got to a point where I needed to choose business or coding.</p>
    <p>Chose coding, worked with agencies <a href="https://fictivekin.com/" target="blank" class="text-link">Fictive Kin</a> and <a href="https://www.basisworldwide.com/Basis" target="blank" class="text-link">Basis</a> as a front end engineer. 
      Then wanted to try product side, started working as a full stack engineer at <a href="https://alchemyway.com/" target="blank" class="text-link">Alchemy</a></p>
    <p>Now I'm here, somwhere in between senior front end engineer, developer, artist, full stack. Not a unicorn or 10x, but a management track engineer with experience in a variety of stacks, a high EQ and a sharp design eye.</p>
    <p>I love brutalism, rapid prototyping, desigining in browser, turning dry technical concepts into hilarious presentations, playing with public APIs, collaborating, starting, finishing and the process.</p>
