      <p>Oh, me? Ok. Well. My mom was a coder and pushed me into it in highschool. Wanted to hate it but was top of my Computer Science class in high school. Can show you some diary entries. Took a detour, but got back into coding in 2010 when I realised the internet was the most powerful tool for making ideas real.
    Studied front end development at the circus, interned at Armchair with some sweet southern geniuses. As soon as I could make a website, turns out everyone needs a website.</p>
    <p>Started freelancing, had more business than I knew what to do with. Did that, got to a point where I needed to choose business or coding.</p>
    <p>Chose coding, started working at Basis as a front end engineer. Then wanted to try product side, started working as a full stack engineer at Alchemy.</p>
    <p>Now I'm here, somwhere in between senior front end engineer, developer, artist, full stack. Not a unicorn or 10x, but a management track engineer with experience in a variety of stacks, a high EQ and a sharp design eye.</p>
    <p>I love brutalism, rapid prototyping, desigining in browser, turning dry technical concepts into hilarious presentations, playing with public APIs, collaborating, starting, finishing and the process.</p>
    <p>PS I not longer own judithprays.com because i let the registration slip for a moment and some shark in MN got it and wants 5k for it so just fyi, thats not me.</p>
